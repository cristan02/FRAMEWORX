            Painting is the practice of applying paint, pigment, color or
            other medium to a solid surface (called the "matrix" or "support").
            The medium is commonly applied to the base with a brush, but other implements, 
            such as knives, sponges, and airbrushes, can be used.
            <br>
            The expression of ideas and emotions, with the creation of certain aesthetic 
            qualities, in a two-dimensional visual language. The elements of this language—its 
            shapes, lines, colours, tones, and textures—are used in various ways to produce 
            sensations of volume, space, movement, and light on a flat surface.

                    color as the soap, toilet paper, and tiles. It means there is a connection between
                    them, and an environment of order. Home is a place not only of comfort, but of control.  
                    This sense of order, in whatever form it takes, acts as a shield against the unpredictability 
                    and lurking chaos of the outside world.
    
                    My work is an examination of the different forms this shield takes, and the thinking 
                    that lies behind it. I use domestic objects as the common denominators of our personal
                    environment. Altering them is a way of questioning the attitudes, fears and unwritten 
                    rules which have formed that environment and our behavior within it.<br></div></td>

                        well as a tension between the way it looks to whoever is caring for it and the way it 
                        looks to me. Trouble is, the kinds of places I find most appealing keep getting closed 
                        or torn down.
            
                        What do I want to say with my art?

                        small-scale, the eccentric, the ordinary: whatever is made out of caring. Respect what 
                        people have built for themselves. Find the beauty in some battered old porch or cluttered, 
                        human-scale storefront, while it still stands.<br></div></td>
